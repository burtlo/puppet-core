# Motivation: DMG files provide a true HFS file system
# and are easier to manage and .pkg bundles.
#
# Note: the 'apple' Provider checks for the package name
# in /L/Receipts.  Since we install multiple pkg's from a single
# source, we treat the source .pkg.dmg file as the package name.
# As a result, we store installed .pkg.dmg file names
# in /var/db/.puppet_pkgdmg_installed_<name>

Author: Jeff McCune <jeff@northstarlabs.net>

Please direct questions about this provider to the puppet-users mailing list.

This package works by checking the contents of a DMG image for Apple pkg or
mpkg files. Any number of pkg or mpkg files may exist in the root directory of
the DMG file system. Sub directories are not checked for packages.

This provider always assumes the label (formerly called 'name') attribute
declared in the manifest will always exactly match the file name (without
path) of the DMG file itself. Therefore, if you want to install packages in
'Foobar.pkg.dmg' you must explicitly specify the label::

    package { Foobar.pkg.dmg: ensure => installed, provider => pkgdmg }

Only the dmg file name itself is used when puppet determines if the packages
contained within are currently installed. For example, if a package resource
named 'Foobar.pkg.dmg' is named for installation and contains multiple
packages, this provider will install all packages in the root directory of
this file system, then create a small cookie for the whole bundle, located at
/var/db/.puppet_pkgdmg_installed_Foobar.pkg.dmg

As a result, if you change the contents of the DMG file in any way, Puppet
will not update or re-install the packages contained within unless you change
the file name of the DMG wrapper itself. Therefore, if you use this provider,
I recommend you name the DMG wrapper files in a manner that lends itself to
incremental version changes. I include some version or date string in the DMG
name, like so::

    Firefox-2.0.0.3-1.pkg.dmg

If I realize I've mis-packaged this DMG, then I have the option to increment
the package version, yielding Firefox-2.0.0.3-2.pkg.dmg.

This provider allows you to host DMG files within an FTP or HTTP server. This
is primarily how the author provider distributes software. Any URL mechanism
curl or Ruby's open-uri module supports is supported by this provider. Curl
supported URL's yield much faster data throughput than open-uri, so I
recommend HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP for source package repositories.

Because the provider assumes packages will be transfered via CURL, a two stage
process occurs. First, if a URL is detected, curl is invoked to transfer the
file into a temporary directory. If no URL is present, the provider skips
straight to step 2. In step two, the source file is mounted, then packages
installed, and finally the DMG file is removed.

If this is a problem for you, please patch the code, or bug Jeff to fix this.

Example usage::

    package { Thunderbird-2.0.0.4-1.pkg.dmg:
      provider => pkgdmg, ensure => present
      source => 'http://0.0.0.0:8000/packages/Thunderbird-2.0.0.4-1.pkg.dmg',
    }

**WARNING**: Because I assume files will be downloaded to /tmp, the current
implementation attempts to delete DMG files if you install directly from the
file system and not via a URL method."
